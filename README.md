# Clauditor 🔎

> *Claude + auditor.* An autonomous PR auditor powered by [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).

A local webhook server that watches GitHub pull requests and uses Claude Code to:

1. **Address review feedback** — when a reviewer leaves a comment, Clauditor evaluates it, applies the fix, commits, and replies.
2. **Auto-review on request** — when a configured user is requested as a reviewer, Clauditor runs `claude -p /review` and posts a formal PR review.

All HMAC-verified, queue-serialized, and confined to non-protected branches.

## How It Works

The bot handles two distinct workflows, dispatched by GitHub event type:

### A. Review-comment workflow (existing)

```
PR review/issue comment
        │
        ▼
Webhook → Queue → handlers/comment.js
        │
        ▼
Clone PR branch (shallow)
        │
        ▼
claude -p (custom prompt) → { actionable, summary, reason }
        │
        ├── actionable → Edit files → commit + push → reply ✅
        └── not actionable → reply 🤖 with explanation
```

### B. Review-request workflow (new)

```
PR review_requested for $GITHUB_REVIEW_REQUEST_USER
        │
        ▼
Webhook → Queue → handlers/reviewRequest.js
        │
        ▼
Full clone (head + base for diffing)
        │
        ▼
claude -p /review  (built-in slash command, headless)
        │
        ▼
GitHub API: POST /pulls/{n}/reviews   (event: COMMENT)
```

Both workflows go through the same Express server, HMAC-verified webhook, and a single in-memory job queue.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| Node.js ≥ 18 | https://nodejs.org |
| Claude Code CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Tailscale | https://tailscale.com/download |
| Git | Pre-installed on most systems |

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd clauditor
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=your-github-username
```

### 2. GitHub Token Permissions

Create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with:
- `repo` → Full control (needed to read code, push commits, comment)
- Or fine-grained: `contents:write`, `pull_requests:write`, `issues:write`

### 3. Authenticate Claude Code

```bash
claude auth login
```

### 4. Start the Bot

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The script will:
1. Validate your `.env`
2. Install npm dependencies
3. Start Tailscale Funnel and print your public webhook URL
4. Start the Express server

### 5. Configure GitHub Webhook

Go to your repo → **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Payload URL | `https://your-machine.ts.net/webhook` |
| Content type | `application/json` |
| Secret | Same as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` |
| Events | ✅ Pull request review comments, ✅ Pull request reviews, ✅ Issue comments, ✅ Pull requests |

### Supported event types

| GitHub event | What it covers | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Inline comment on a specific line of code in a review | Apply targeted fix |
| `pull_request_review` | Review summary (Approve / Request changes / Comment) | Apply targeted fix |
| `issue_comment` | Plain comment on the PR conversation tab (PR-attached only) | Apply targeted fix |
| `pull_request` (`review_requested`) | Configured user requested as PR reviewer | Run `claude -p /review` and post a formal review |

Notes:
- `issue_comment` also fires for plain issues — the bot ignores those. For PR-attached issue comments the head ref isn't in the payload, so the bot fetches the PR via the GitHub API to learn the branch.
- `pull_request` covers many actions; only `review_requested` is processed, and only when the requested reviewer matches `GITHUB_REVIEW_REQUEST_USER`. Team review requests are ignored. Leave the env var unset to disable the feature.

## Safety Features

| Concern | How It's Handled |
|---------|-----------------|
| Fake webhooks | HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on every request |
| Bot reply loops | Ignores comments from `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` |
| Accidental pushes to main | `PROTECTED_BRANCHES` list blocks any push |
| Runaway Claude | `--max-turns 10` + `CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MS` limit |
| Concurrent jobs | Single-file queue serializes all jobs |
| Claude changes nothing | Detects empty `git status`, throws error instead of empty commit |

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | GitHub PAT with repo access |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | ✅ | — | Webhook HMAC secret |
| `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` | ✅ | — | Your GitHub username (for loop prevention) |
| `GITHUB_REVIEW_REQUEST_USER` | | _empty_ | When this user is requested as a PR reviewer, the bot runs `/review` and posts a formal review. Empty disables the feature. |
| `PORT` | | `3000` | Local server port |
| `PROTECTED_BRANCHES` | | `main,master,develop` | Branches bot won't push to |
| `GIT_EMAIL` | | `pr-bot@localhost` | Git commit email |
| `GIT_NAME` | | `PR Review Bot` | Git commit name |
| `CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MS` | | `300000` | Max time for Claude to run (ms) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | | `info` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |

## What Claude Decides

Claude evaluates each comment and returns a structured JSON decision:

**Actionable** → Claude modifies the code, commits, pushes, and replies:
```
✅ Addressed by Claude Code (commit `a1b2c3d`)

> Your variable names are unclear, use `userCount` instead of `n`

What was done: Renamed variable `n` to `userCount` in auth.js lines 42-67
```

**Not actionable** → Claude explains why and replies without touching code:
```
🤖 Claude Code reviewed this feedback but determined it may not require a code change

> This looks fine to me

Reason: The comment is an approval, not a request for changes.
```

## Running as a Background Service (optional)

To keep the bot running after you close your terminal:

```bash
# Using PM2
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/server.js --name clauditor
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Webhook not reaching server:**
```bash
tailscale funnel status
```

**Claude Code not authorized:**
```bash
claude auth login
```

**See detailed logs:**
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug node src/server.js
```

**Test webhook locally without GitHub:**
```bash
npm run test:webhook
# or: node scripts/test-webhook.js
```
